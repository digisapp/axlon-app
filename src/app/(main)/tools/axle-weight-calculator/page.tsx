              <p>
                The federal bridge formula limits the weight based on the number of axles
                and the distance between them. This protects bridges and roads from excessive
                stress caused by concentrated heavy loads.

              <p>
                Many states have weight limits that differ from federal standards. Some states
                allow higher weights with permits, while others have stricter limits on certain
                roads. Always check local regulations for your route.

              <p>
                Adjusting your trailer tandems (sliding them forward or back) shifts weight
                between the drive axles and trailer axles. This is the primary method drivers
                use to balance loads and stay legal.

              <h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Fifth Wheel Position</h3>
              <p>
                On some tractors, the fifth wheel can be adjusted to shift weight between
                the steer axle and drive axles. Moving it forward puts more weight on the
                steer axle; moving it back shifts weight to the drives.
